        <h1>P1 Report - Kyle LaCanna</h1>
        <h2>9/30/2021</h2>
        <p>
            In the following section of this report I will breifly 
            address each point and explain how I covered it in my project.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>I choose the theme of a cookie and dessert treats shop.</li>
            <li>All of the content that is in my website is my original work besides for the photos and embeded links.
                 Also all of the photos used had a Creative Commons License.</li>
            <li>I have 5 seperate pages in my website (home, menu, delivery, about us, and login) and the default page is index.html.</li>
            <li>My website includes a header that contains the navigation bar and the content has a seperate header with the page title.</li>
            <li>I include navigation links in the navigation bar with the cookie bringing you to the home page and title links for the rest.</li>
            <li>I use a media query to allow the site to adapt to smaller phone screens and it increases the size of the nav bar so that wrapped text will not go over the edge.</li>
            <li>I maintain a common theme throughout the pages and have created a common css document for shared styling.</li>
            <li>I have included a insane amount of images and have made all of their alt tabs very discriptive.</li>
            <li>I have included a favicon of a cookie which is also my fake websites logo.</li>
            <li>I have a very neat directory and have folders for images and styling documents.</li>
            <li>I have not used and libraries or frameworks.</li>
            <li>All of my links validate with the Nu Validator.</li>
            <li>My content is neatly right-aligned with only minimal things being centered.</li>
            <li>All of the spacing is consistant with the other pages and the margins for each property carry over. No text is touching the edge of a frame or box.</li>
            <li>My site uses 3 diffrent font faces. The first one is for the links in the navigation bar, the second is for The large titles and headings, and the third is for the paragraph text.</li>
            <li>My site includes a form being the login page, where the user is asked to input an email and password.</li>
            <li>Throughout my site I include 6 links to external pages. Three are for the locations and take the viewer to Wikipedia while the other three take the viewer to a respective delivery companies website.</li>
            <li>Throughout all of my code I have made sure to use "kebab-case" and not to use and uppercase letters when naming classes or ids.</li>
            <li>My site includes a CSS animation on the home page of a delivery man riding around in circles.</li>
            <li>I have shared my repository with the user "hcientist".</li>
            <li>All of my files start with lowercase letters and contain only alphanumeric characters.</li>
            <li>I have made it so http and https both resolve to my website using redirect.</li>
            <li>I have setup lets encrypt and configured port 443 to https.</li>
            <li>I have redirected users to the correct https port.</li>
            <li>My git shows a stead flow of commits, showing steady progress through the development of the website.</li>
            <li>I have created this report showing an itemized breakdown of the expectations that were given to me addressing each one respectivly.</li>
        </ol>
