1. What I really liked about this website was the overall structure of it. I enjoyed the navigation at the top of the page and the content that was used to create this.
This page already looks finished.

2. One significant difference between our projects was definitely the purpose of the site. Yours was a Campus Cookie website where as my website had to do with hosting a
website for my fraternity basketball league. I would say yours has better UX because of the mobile viewport. Mine needs some work. I also think your code was more
maintainable because of the folders. Although I would recommend putting all of your style into a single .css folder for better readability.

3. This question can be answered by my previous answer.

4. No

5. From the way you created and organized this site, I can tell that you have prior experience with web development.
