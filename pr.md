1.) Your website is neat and layed out very well. Every link on your
    page is meaningful and has a distinct format. The links for delivery
    are clever, and the whole webpage looks professional like if I were 
    actually about to order pastries. The page is also dynamicaly resized 
    and containers are formatted automatically to account for this.
    Very well done.
2.) Your page is distinctly different than mine. Yours has a better user 
    experience because each element on the page feels like it has a purpose 
    and jumps out at you. I think your code might be easier to maintain
    than mine because of how all the divs are laid out, you could easily 
    add more elements that can fit into a container and it would be 
    formatted appropriately.
3.) I have no problems for how your code is organized. All the images are
    in one folder and so are the CSS files. Files are named appropriately
    as well.
4.) One issue I had while viewing your page is the log in the navlinks is cut
    for me, I can only see the log and not the log in. Some of your CSS
    is duplicated across files that could easily have fit into one.
    Elements in your code are organized into clear containers which is nice.
5.) One thing I will say is to next time try and test your website with 
    different viewport widths and heights, because your webpage width was 
    larger than my viewport size causing me to scroll horizontally on some
    of your pages.
