Peer Review - Jacob Shulman

1. I really like the layout and color scheme of this website. The colors go well together and convey a very "cookie"-like vibe. 
On the login page, I really like the aesthetics of the text entry boxes; they look much nicer than the generic ones. 

2. As far as the user experiences go, I feel that my website has a better user experience. The navigation aspect of both websites 
are very similar. One slight issue I have is the font size is a bit small and hard to read at times, especially when sitting 2.5-3 
feet away from the screen. I think our codebases are also very similar. Each codebase has repeated code for our headers, which is 
to be expected at this point in our learning. I can't say for sure which codebase would be more maintainable as they are very similar. 

3. The code is well structured. Images are placed in an 'images' directory and CSS files are placed in a 'css' directory. All images 
and stylesheets are linked appropriately. 

4. I do feel that semantically appropriate elements were selected. Especially on the Menu page and other cards, the elements and font 
sizes used were appropriate and appropriately sized. I did see some duplication in the CSS files. For example, the home.css and menu.css 
files have nearly identical attributes for h1 and h2. These could have been placed in a shared style sheet and imported along with the 
non shared styles. 

5. The only other thing I can comment on has to do with the links to external sites. On the Delivery page, I think the logos look very 
professional, especially with them being circles and centered. However, I would have liked to see these links being opened in a new tab 
as opposed to on top of the current page.
